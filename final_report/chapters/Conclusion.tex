\section{Conclusion}
In this project our goal was to implement a SlowFast inspired architecture for VOS, and thereby investigate the benefit of SlowFast Networks for video object segmentation; both for unsupervised and semi-supervised tasks. The takeaway from our results are two fold. First, the benefit of having more and more temporal context vanishes quickly; and second, in the lack of that benefit, there wasn't a benefit that can be observed from applying SlowFast.
