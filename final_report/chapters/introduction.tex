\section{Introduction}
VOS is a computationally expansive task, especially requiring a lot of GPU memory to look into many frames at once. SlowFast architecture, which was successfully applied for video action classification, splits the workload between two branches, allowing it to use less memory. 
Our main goal is to apply SlowFast Networks

 to Video Object Segmentation and to understand if this concept is beneficial for VOS; both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. To this end, we build a SlowFast inspired VOS architecture, and evaluate different configurations on it.
