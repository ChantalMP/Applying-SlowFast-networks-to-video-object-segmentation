\section{Introduction}
The SlowFast architecture \cite{slow_fast}, which was successfully applied for video action classification, splits the workload between two branches, allowing it to use less memory. 
Our main goal is to apply SlowFast Networks \cite{slow_fast}  to Video Object Segmentation and to understand if this concept is beneficial for VOS; both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. To this end, we build a SlowFast inspired VOS architecture, and evaluate different configurations of it.
