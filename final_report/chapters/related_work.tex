\section{Related Work}
The main work of consideration is the SlowFast Network \cite{slow_fast}, which has one fast and one slow pathway, allowing it to concentrate on different aspects of the video while keeping the performance high. The slow pathway is computationally much more expensive than the fast pathway and works with less frames. OSVOS \cite{osvos} focuses on the task of one-shot video object segmentation, where in test time, the network is fine-tuned on the first frame of the video, which has a manually annotated mask. This fine-tuning allows the network to adapt to the object in that video. Mask R-CNN \cite{mask_rcnn} is one of the best known architectures for image segmentation. They extend the popular Faster R-CNN architecture with a masking layer at the end.
