## Applying SlowFast Networks to Video Object Segmentation

In this project we implemented a SlowFast inspired architecture for video object segmentation, and thereby investigated the potential benefit of SlowFast Networks for VOS. 
The takeaway from our results is that there was no substantial benefit observed from applying SlowFast, especially because the benefit of having more and more temporal context vanished quickly.
